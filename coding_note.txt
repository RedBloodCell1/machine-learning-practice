1. np.split(x, num1, num2) = you split the array x into part seperated by num1 and num2 

2. df.sample = output random sample // frac = fraction (ex: 0.25) // then the sample will be randomized and only take 25% of all the data frame.

3. np.hstack = horizontal stack, stacking 2 array into one

4. StandarScaler = standardize features by removing mean and scaling unit variance
