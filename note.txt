Predict 2 thingies whether the thingies is x or y = Classification

Features = things we pass to our model to predict.

Machine Learning (ML) = subdomain of CS that focus on algo that help computer learn from data without explicit programming

Artificial Intelligence (AI) = Computer perform human like behaviour

ML = Subset of AI

Data Science = field that attempts to find patterns and draw insight from data

ML has 2 type:

1. Supervised Learning = uses labeled input to train models and learn outputs.
2. Unsupervised Learing = uses unlabeled data to learn about patterns in data
3. Reinforcement Learning = agent learning in interactive environment based on rewards and penalties

Machine Learning:
input (feature vector) -> model -> output

Features:

1. Qualitative = Caterogical Data (finite number of categories or group) ex: gender, nationality

Nominal Data = No inherent order
Ordinal Data = Inherent Order

Using One Hot Encoding (If the thing matches, then give 1 and other 0)
