Day 1: 0:00:00 - 0:16:00 (21 minute of study)

This if my first day actually learning about machine learning. Im really excited about it. Lets see how it goes.

So i learn a lil bit about what ml actually is and also how to make column with name and also how to use astype. (if = x then true else false)

I know today is short, but i promise tomorrow will be long.
