Day 1: 0:00:00 - 0:16:00 (21 minute of study)

This if my first day actually learning about machine learning. Im really excited about it. Lets see how it goes.

So i learn a lil bit about what ml actually is and also how to make column with name and also how to use astype. (if = x then true else false)

I know today is short, but i promise tomorrow will be long.

Day 2: 0:16:00 - 0:42:26 (2 hours 48 minute of study)

Its 18:45 now, im gonna study till 24:00. See you later.

Im stuck... wait that sound weird. What i mean is im stuck at this one part where i got an error but idk what to fix cause its already exactly the same (00:42:46)

Day 4: 0:42:25 - 1:35:46 (1 hours 52 minute of study)

I know im gone yesterday and im sorry for that. I will study now 22:14. See you later.

Understanding the basic of KNN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression took me a really long time. I really try to understand the base of each algorithm and i still have a little bit of problem with naive bayes but i think i roughly understand each model. IDK if its good trying to understand this. But either way, i already study today and its already 0:32. I need to fix my sleeping schedule and try to study early at the morning and not at the night but everyone has their own style of studying. See you tomorrow \*today
