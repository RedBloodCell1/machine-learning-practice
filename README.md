Day 1: 0:00:00 - 0:16:00 (21 minute of study)

This if my first day actually learning about machine learning. Im really excited about it. Lets see how it goes.

So i learn a lil bit about what ml actually is and also how to make column with name and also how to use astype. (if = x then true else false)

I know today is short, but i promise tomorrow will be long.

Day 2: 0:16:00 - 0:42:26 (2 hours 48 minute of study)

Its 18:45 now, im gonna study till 24:00. See you later.

Im stuck... wait that sound weird. What i mean is im stuck at this one part where i got an error but idk what to fix cause its already exactly the same (00:42:46)

Day 4: 0:42:25 - 1:28:48 (1 hours 52 minute of study)

I know im gone yesterday and im sorry for that. I will study now 22:14. See you later.

Understanding the basic of KNN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression took me a really long time. I really try to understand the base of each algorithm and i still have a little bit of problem with naive bayes but i think i roughly understand each model. IDK if its good trying to understand this. But either way, i already study today and its already 0:32. I need to fix my sleeping schedule and try to study early at the morning and not at the night but everyone has their own style of studying. See you tomorrow \*today

Day 5: 1:28:48 - 1:50:18 (20 minutes of study)

Its 0:25 and idk if its still day 5 or not. Im still gonna study for a while tho. You guys might be wondering why i could study for 20 minutes and got 22 minutes of the video, Well i watch the video with 2 times speed as it is more efficient for me. Some might say that i wont be able to focus or understand what im watching with that speed, well for me with 10 years of experience watching something at 2 times the speed, watching normal speed is the same as how normies watch something with 0.5 speed. So yeah thats it. Today i learn about SVM and Neural Network which i already understand quite a bit. Well its 0:51 now and im gonna stop. I know its short but its something. See you today.

Day 7:

I will study tomorrow. Im feel sorry for myself but its saturday and sunday and i spend my time socially. I know its only an excuse, tomorrow i will study as much as i can and do my homework. Promise.

Day 8: 1:50:18 - Done (1 hours 40 minute)

Its 22:44, I will study now. Because i already promise i need to do it. (I will sacrifice my sleep. Because i already sleep). I know its bad but i need to do it. I will study.

I dont learn much today or thats what i feel like, I only watched the video and i mostly zone out. Its kinda hard to understand the videos explanation by itself without knowing some python basics but overall its a really good video if you already understand a python a bit. Well thats it for today, I will see you guys today on a different video without coding. I will still document it tho on another git. See you later.
